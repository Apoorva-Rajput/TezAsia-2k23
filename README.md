Team Name = TechNerds
Project name = Healthare data system using blockchain
Project's Description = The project develops a decentralized web application utilizing blockchain technology to secure and manage medical health records. It aims to enhance data security, privacy, and patient control while enabling efficient data sharing with authorized healthcare providers. Through smart contracts, cryptographic measures, and user-friendly interfaces, the project seeks to revolutionize traditional healthcare data management systems. The project also explores scalability, legal considerations, and potential for future integration with existing healthcare ecosystems. Ultimately, it envisions a patient-centric future where blockchain ensures the integrity, accessibility, and confidentiality of medical health records.
What problem you are trying to solve = We are addressing the vulnerabilities of centralized healthcare data management systems by leveraging blockchain technology. Traditional systems lack robust security, leading to data breaches and compromised patient privacy. Our project aims to create a decentralized web application that provides secure, tamper-resistant storage and sharing of medical health records. Through blockchain's cryptographic features and patient-controlled access, we're mitigating risks, ensuring data integrity, and granting patients greater control over their sensitive health information. By enhancing data security and privacy, we seek to revolutionize healthcare data management, benefiting both patients and authorized healthcare providers.
Tech Stack used while building the project = The project employs a tech stack encompassing blockchain platforms like Ethereum for data security and immutability. Smart contracts ensure access control and privacy. The decentralized web application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing React for dynamic front-end. Node.js and Express.js power the back-end, enabling secure data processing. Testing employs Ganache. Additionally, used Web 3 and Truffle This comprehensive tech stack guarantees a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution for enhancing medical health records management through blockchain technology.
